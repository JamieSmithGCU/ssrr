# Scottish Space Rock Register

#### This is our Integrated Project 3 solution
As a group we decided that we wanted to develop
a web based application which records and visualises
data from NASA's NEO API.

##### What Does the S.S.R.R do with the API data?
The Scottish Space Rock Registry collects data about Near
Earth Objects recorded by NASA and partner satellites.
This data allows us to calculate the radius of a NEO's orbit
and see which point it will be closest to earth. Using this
data we calculate the date it will be closest to earth and
the co-ordinates on earth where the NEO will be most visible
through a telescope in the night sky.

##### Want more?
The S.S.R.R has will record all of these NEOs and also
offer a searchable register with more detailed information
about these NEOs.
