# Scottish Space Rock Register

### This is our Integrated Project 3 solution
As a group we decided that we wanted to develop
a web based application which records and visualises
data from NASA's NEO API.

#### What Does the S.S.R.R do with the API data?
The Scottish Space Rock Register collects data about Landed Meteorites.
This data allows us to visualise areas on earth by co-ordinates
where meteorites have landed and display more information. 

#### Want more?
The S.S.R.R has will record all of these NEOs and also
offer a searchable register with more detailed information
about these NEOs.
